questions for Brando:

should I set 'type' of hand at the beginning of each play (as opposed to checking it each time)

all the logic I just did...I still need 'can I play on top of middle cards' logic. Should that go in the same functions or be separate functions?

need advice on poker hand logic:

1) I have 'isValidPokerHand' function which finds which poker hand it is (if it is one), should I return the type of poker hand as well? Seems like it would make sense
