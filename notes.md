##Things to implement

- joining a room
	1. validation for: username, lobby (any others?)
	2. rooms should max out once 4 people are logged in (i.e. no one else should be able to join)
- should I be concerned about using my PC as a server to host the game for my buddies and I? (i.e. getting hacked) 

##Next Steps
- ~~make a register endpoint~~
- ~~make a register screen~~
- ~~make a token endpoint~~
- ~~make a login screen~~
- create useAuth hook using Context (to save token in LocalStorage)
- show join room after logging in
- setup stats using ID from token
